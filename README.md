# Overview
This react / redux / rails / actioncable applicationw as created during Flatiron School Online Structured Cohort of 060721. Our plan for this application was to create a chat application and learn about websockets and how to learn a new technology. Together as I the instructor has never used actioncable decided to build an application together with the students to use actioncable as the premises for our websockets. We wanted to see how we could connect a frontend such as React + Redux to the rails backend and see how it connects.

Students were able to see how an experienced developer would be able to learn newer technologies by:
  * Reading Documentation
  * Testing
  * Not being afraid to break things!

### How to run

Already assuming you have node, ruby, rails installed, you will need to:

  1. Fork / clone
  2. Bundle install
  3. Run the rails server with `rails s`
  4. CD into client and yarn or npm install
  5. Run the react server with yarn start or npm start
  6. Open the browsers @ http://localhost:3000 and enjoy!
